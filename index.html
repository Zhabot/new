          The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only
          domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as
          the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.
          The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely
          ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is valued by humans
          for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat
          breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

          Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong
          flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws
          adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active
          at dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too
          high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other
          small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they
          see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell, but
          poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a
          social species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations
          including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as
          well as cat-specific body language.[7] Cats also communicate by
          secreting and perceiving pheromones.

          Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with
          litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats can be
          bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
          fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and
          neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large
          numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of
          entire birdd species, and evoking population control.
